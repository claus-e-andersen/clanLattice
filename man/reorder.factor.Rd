\arguments{
\item{Factor}{is the vector of factors to be reordered}

\item{Function}{is a function used on the aggregared data in x. The reordering will be
based on these results.}

\item{...}{Any other values that could be supplied to Function}

\item{x}{is a vector of numerical values with the same length as Factor.}

\value{
A reordered factor
}
\description{

levels in the factor.
